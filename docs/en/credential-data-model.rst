Digital Credential Data Model
==============================

A Digital Credential data model has the following structure:

- **Metadata attributes**:

  - **Format-Agnostic**: These are high-level metadata attributes that describe the Digital Credential independently of its encoding format. They represent the semantic information about the credential (e.g., credential_type_identifier, issuing_authority, expiry_date) and remain conceptually consistent across different formats. When a credential is encoded, these common metadata attributes are mapped to format-specific technical parameters according to the encoding rules of each format (SD-JWT-VC or mdoc-CBOR).
  - **Format-Specific**: These are metadata parameters that are intrinsic to the specific encoding format and serve technical purposes related to the format's security model and protocol requirements.

- **User attributes**: Information about the User, such as identity or qualifications.

The Person Identification Data (PID) is issued by the PID Provider according to national laws and it MUST be provided in SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR data format. The main scope of the PID is allowing natural persons to be authenticated for access to a service or to a protected resource.
The PID MUST be provided according to data model requirements defined in  `EU_2024/2977`_ and **Section 2 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_], the User attributes provided within the Italian PID are the ones listed below:

- Current Family Name
- Current First Name
- Date of Birth
- Place of Birth
- Nationality
- User identification number across public Relying Party services (for example the *taxpayer identification number*)

In addition to the User attributes listed above, the PID includes also the following metadata attributes (`EU_2024/2977`_ and **Section 2 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_]):

- Issuing authority
- Issuing country
- Expiry Date
- Validity status information
- Identity and data proofing information 

Some attributes, such as the *taxpayer identification number* and the *identity and data proofing information*, are provided as **domestic extensions** defined by the Italian IT-Wallet specification. It is NOT part of the ARF PID Rulebook (Annex 3.01, PID Rulebook v1.3), but is **permitted under ARF requirement PID_06**, which allows Member States to define additional domestic attributes beyond those specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (CIR) 2024/2977 (`EU_2024/2977`_). In particular, the identity proofing information is REQUIRED for Italian PIDs to ensure:

- Traceability of User authentication method.
- Level of Assurance compliance of identity proofing during the enrollment process (LoA as defined by eIDAS Regulation).
- Auditability of identity and User attributes verification processes.

Attributes that are **domestic extensions** MUST be included in the **domestic namespaces** that are defined in Section :ref:`credential-data-model:PID Data Model in SD-JWT-VC Format` and Section :ref:`credential-data-model:PID Data Model in mdoc-CBOR Format` for SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR PIDs respectively.

The (Q)EAAs are issued by (Q)EAA Issuers to a Wallet Instance and MUST be provided in SD-JWT-VC or mdoc-CBOR data format.
While the (Q)EAA data model is use-case driven and may include different User attributes, the metadata attributes specific for each data format are provided in the following sections.  

Format-Agnostic Credential Metadata Attributes
-----------------------------------------------

The following table defines the common metadata attributes that are applicable to Digital Credentials regardless of their encoding format. These attributes represent the semantic information about the credential.

  :header-rows: 1

  * - **Data Identifier**
    - **Description**

  * - **issuing_authority**
    - REQUIRED. Name of the administrative authority that issued the Digital Credential.
  * - **issuing_country**
    - REQUIRED. Alpha-2 country code, as specified in ISO 3166-1, of the country or territory of the Credential Issuer.

The following sections provide format-specific attributes and a mapping of the above metadata attributes to format-specific technical parameters when the credential is encoded in SD-JWT-VC or mdoc-CBOR format.

SD-JWT-VC Credential Format
---------------------------

When Digital Credentials are issued in the SD-JWT-VC format, they MUST be compliant to `SD-JWT`_ and `SD-JWT-VC`_ specifications.

SD-JWT-VC Digital Credentials MUST be signed using the Issuer's private key. SD-JWT-VC Digital Credentials MAY be provided along with a Type Metadata Document related to the issued Credential according to Sections 6 and 6.3 of [`SD-JWT-VC`_]. The payload of Digital Credentials MUST contain the **_sd_alg** claim described in Section 4.1.1 `SD-JWT`_ and other claims specified in this section.

The claim **_sd_alg** indicates the hash algorithm used by the Issuer to generate the digests as described in Section 4.1.1 of `SD-JWT`_. **_sd_alg** MUST be set to one of the specified algorithms in Section :ref:`Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms:Cryptographic Algorithms>`.

Claims that are not selectively disclosable MUST be included in the SD-JWT as they are. The digests of the disclosures, along with any decoy if present, MUST be contained in the **_sd** array, as specified in Section 4.2.4.1 of `SD-JWT`_.

The Disclosures are provided to the Holder together with the SD-JWT in the *Combined Format for Issuance* that is an ordered series of base64url-encoded values, each separated from the next by a single tilde ('~') character as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  <Issuer-Signed-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>

See `SD-JWT-VC`_ and `SD-JWT`_ for additional details.

PID Data Model in SD-JWT-VC Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the SD-JWT-VC PID defined in this specification, the ``vct`` value MUST be ``urn:eudi:pid:it:1`` in compliance with ARF PID Rulebook v1.3 requirements for domestic PID extensions (requirement **PID_14**, Section 4.2, extending the base type ``urn:eudi:pid:``).

.. note::
   **Transitional Phase:**

   During the transitional phase before full EUDIW operability, national implementations MAY use the ``vct`` value ``urn:it-wallet:pid:1``. Upon reaching full EUDIW operability, all implementations MUST transition to the EUDI-compliant identifier ``urn:eudi:pid:it:1`` specified above.

Digital Credential Type Metadata Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When provided, the Type Metadata Document MUST be a *JSON object* compliant with Section 6.2 of [`SD-JWT-VC`_].

A non-normative Digital Credential metadata type is provided below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/vc-metadata-type.json
  :language: JSON

The Credential Type Metadata JSON Document MAY be retrieved through a *well-known* endpoint. See Section 6.3.3 of `SD-JWT-VC`_.
This endpoint, provided by the Credential Issuer, MUST have the following format: ``https://{Credential Issuer Domain}/.well-known/vct/{vct}``.
The Endpoint returns a ``200 OK`` status code and supports ``application/json`` and ``application/jwt`` as content type.

Below a non-normative example is given.

mdoc-CBOR Credential Format
---------------------------

When Digital Credentials are issued in mdoc-CBOR format, they MUST be based on the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard.

The mdoc data elements MUST be encoded in CBOR as defined in :rfc:`8949`.

This data model structures mdoc Digital Credentials into distinct components: namespaces (**nameSpaces**), and cryptographic proof (**issuerAuth**).
Namespaces categorize and structure data elements (or attributes, see :ref:`credential-data-model:Attribute Namespaces`). While the cryptographic proof ensures integrity and authenticity through the Mobile Security Object (MSO).

The MSO securely stores cryptographic digests of attributes within the `nameSpaces`. This allows Relying Parties to validate disclosed attributes against corresponding **digestID** values without revealing the entire Credential.
See :ref:`credential-data-model:Mobile Security Object` for details.

An mdoc-CBOR Digital Credential MUST be compliant with the following structure:

.. _table_mdoc_structure:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Parameter**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **nameSpaces**
      - *(map)*. The namespaces within which the data elements are defined. A Digital Credential MAY include multiple namespaces. 
      - [ISO 18013-5#8.3.2.1.2]
    * - **issuerAuth**
      - *(COSE_Sign1)*. Contains *Mobile Security Object* (MSO), a COSE Sign1 Document, issued by the Credential Issuer.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]


.. note::
  Mandatory mDL attributes utilize the standard namespace `org.iso.18013.5.1`. However, it MAY have a domestic namespace, such as `org.iso.18013.5.1.IT`, to include additional attributes defined in this implementation profile. Each namespace within the `nameSpaces` MUST share the same issued document type (`docType`) value, which identifies the nature of the Digital Credential, as defined in the `issuerAuth`.

The structure of an mdoc-CBOR Credential is further elaborated in the following sections.

Mobile Security Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **issuerAuth** represents the `Mobile Security Object` which is a `COSE Sign1 Document` defined in :rfc:`9052`. It has the following data structure:

   * protected header
   * unprotected header
   * payload
   * signature.

The **protected header** MUST contain the following parameter encoded in CBOR format:

.. _table_protected_headers_mdoc:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Element**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **1**
      - *(int)*. Algorithm used to verify the cryptographic signature of the mdoc Digital Credential.
      - :rfc:`9053`

.. note::
  Only the signature algorithm MUST be present in the protected header, other elements SHOULD not be present in the protected header.

The **unprotected header** MUST contain the following parameters, unless otherwise specified:

.. _table_unprotected_headers_mdoc:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20

      - *(array)*. X.509 certificate chain about the Issuer. Required for X.509 certificate-based authentication.
      - :rfc:`9360`

.. note::
  The `x5chain` is included in the unprotected header with the aim to allow the Holder to update the X.509 certificate chain, related to the `Mobile Security Object` issuer, without invalidating the signature.

The **payload** MUST contain the *MobileSecurityObject*, without the `content-type` COSE Sign header parameter and encoded as a *byte string* (bstr) using the *CBOR Tag* 24.

The `MobileSecurityObject` MUST have the following attributes, unless otherwise specified:

.. _table_MobileSecurityObject_attributes:

  The private key related to the public key stored in the `deviceKey` map is used to sign the `DeviceSignedItems` and to prove the possession of the Digital Credential during the presentation phase (see the presentation phase with mdoc-CBOR).

Attribute Namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **nameSpaces** contains one or more *nameSpace* entries, each identified by a name. Within each **nameSpace**, it includes one or more *IssuerSignedItemBytes*, each encoded as a CBOR byte string with Tag 24 (#6.24(bstr .cbor)), which appears as 24(<<... >>) in diagnostic notation. It represents the disclosure information for each digest within the `Mobile Security Object` and MUST contain the following attributes:

.. note::
  Digital Credential User-specific attributes are defined in the Catalog of Digital Credentials.
  User-specific attributes for mdoc Digital Credentials such as those used in mDL or PID are also included by referencing the appropriate `elementIdentifiers` defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 or the `EIDAS-ARF`_ specification.

.. note::
  Regardless of the Digital Credential type, the `sub` value MUST NOT be shown to the User, as it is not a User attribute. It is used for identification purposes by the Credential Issuers.

PID Data Model in mdoc-CBOR Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PID in mdoc-CBOR format MUST use the **docType** ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1`` in compliance with ARF requirement **PID_04**.

The PID attributes MUST be encoded as specified in **Section 3 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_] and organized in the following namespaces:

- **Standard ARF PID attributes**: namespace ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
- **Italian domestic extensions**: namespace ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``

.. note::
   **Transitional Phase:**

   During the transitional phase before full EUDIW operability, national implementations MAY use the **docType** ``{Trust Anchor reverse domain}.pid.1`` with a single national namespace ``{Trust Anchor reverse domain}.pid.1`` for all attributes. Upon reaching full EUDIW operability, all implementations MUST transition to the EUDI-compliant **docType** and namespace structure specified above.

According to `EU_2024/2977`_ and **Section 3 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_], the PID in mdoc-CBOR format includes the following User Attributes:

.. _table_mdoc-cbor_pid_attributes:

    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **elementIdentifier**

      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **birth_date**
      - REQUIRED. *(full-date)*. Date of Birth. It MUST be encoded as full-date string according to :rfc:`8949`.
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **place_of_birth**
      - REQUIRED. *(map)*. Place of Birth. At least one of ``country``, ``region``, ``locality`` MUST be present.
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **nationality**
      - REQUIRED. *(array of tstr)*. One or more Alpha-2 country codes as specified in ISO 3166-1. Encoded as CDDL type ``nationalities`` (array of country codes).
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **personal_administrative_number**
      - REQUIRED if ``tax_id_code`` is not present, OPTIONAL otherwise. *(tstr)*. National unique identifier of a natural person generated by ANPR.
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **tax_id_code**

      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``

In addition to the mandatory metadata attributes defined in :ref:`MobileSecurityObject Table <table_MobileSecurityObject_attributes>` and :ref:`mdoc-CBOR Metadata Attributes Table <table_element_identifiers_mdoc>`, the following metadata attributes are REQUIRED for a PID:

.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **elementIdentifier**
      - **Namespace**
    * - **expiry_date**
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **sub**
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``
    * - **validityInfo.signed**
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``
    * - **verification**
      - ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``

.. note::
   **Key differences from SD-JWT encoding:**

   The ARF PID Rulebook v1.3 uses different claim names between SD-JWT and mdoc-CBOR formats:

   - mdoc uses ``birth_date`` (not ``birthdate`` as in SD-JWT)
   - mdoc uses ``expiry_date`` (not ``date_of_expiry`` as in SD-JWT)
   - mdoc uses ``nationality`` (not ``nationalities`` as in SD-JWT). Note: both formats encode the value as an array of country codes.

   See Section 3.1.1 (mdoc encoding) and Section 4.1.1 (SD-JWT encoding) of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3 for the complete mapping.

Cross-Format Credential Parameters Mapping
------------------------------------------

The following table provides a comparative mapping between the data structures of SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR Digital Credentials.
It outlines the key data elements and parameters used in each format, highlighting both commonalities and differences.
In particular, it shows how core concepts - such as Credential Issuer information, validity, Cryptographic Binding, and disclosures - are represented in these Credential formats.

For SD-JWT-VC, parameters are marked with `(hdr)` if they are located in the JOSE header, and `(pld)` if they appear in the payload of the JWT. In mdoc-CBOR, these parameters are identified within the issuerAuth or nameSpaces structures.
