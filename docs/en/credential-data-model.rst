Digital Credential Data Model
==============================

The Digital Credential Data Model structures Digital Credentials for secure, interoperable use. Key elements include:

    - Credential Subject: The individual or entity receiving the Credential.
    - Issuer: The Credential Issuer issuing and signing the Credential.
    - Metadata: Details about the Credential, like type and validity.
    - Claims: Information about the subject, such as identity or qualifications.
    - Proof: Cryptographic verification of authenticity and legitimate ownership.

The Person Identification Data (PID) is issued by the PID Provider according to national laws and it MUST be provided in SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR data format. The main scope of the PID is allowing natural persons to be authenticated for access to a service or to a protected resource.
The PID MUST be provided according to data model requirements defined in  `EU_2024/2977`_ and **Section 2 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_], the User attributes provided within the Italian PID are the ones listed below:

    - Current Family Name
    - Current First Name
    - Date of Birth
    - Place of Birth
    - Nationality
    - Taxpayer identification number (data identifier: `tax_id_code`)

In addition to the User attributes listed above, the PID includes also the following metadata attributes (`EU_2024/2977`_ and **Section 2 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_]):

  - Expiry Date
  - Issuing authority
  - Issuing country
  - Identity proofing information (data identifier: `verification`)

The *taxpayer identification number* and the *identity proofing information* are provided as **domestic extensions** defined by the Italian IT-Wallet specification. It is NOT part of the ARF PID Rulebook (Annex 3.01, PID Rulebook v1.3), but is **permitted under ARF requirement PID_06**, which allows Member States to define additional domestic attributes beyond those specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (CIR) 2024/2977 (`EU_2024/2977`_). In particular, the identity proofing information is REQUIRED for Italian PIDs to ensure:

- Traceability of User authentication method.
- Level of assurance compliance (LoA High/Substantial per eIDAS Regulation).
- Auditability of identity verification processes.

Both claims are included in the **domestic namespaces** that are defined in Section :ref:`credential-data-model:PID Data Model in SD-JWT-VC Format` and Section :ref:`credential-data-model:PID Data Model in mdoc-CBOR Format` for SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR PIDs respectively.

The (Q)EAAs are issued by (Q)EAA Issuers to a Wallet Instance and MUST be provided in SD-JWT-VC or mdoc-CBOR data format.
While the (Q)EAA data model is use-case driven and may include different User attributes, the metadata attributes specific for each data format are provided in the following sections.  

SD-JWT-VC Credential Format
---------------------------

The PID/(Q)EAA is issued in the form of a Digital Credential. The Digital Credential format is `SD-JWT`_ as specified in `SD-JWT-VC`_.

SD-JWT MUST be signed using the Issuer's private key. SD-JWT MUST be provided along with a Type Metadata related to the issued Digital Credential according to Sections 6 and 6.3 of [`SD-JWT-VC`_]. The payload MUST contain the **_sd_alg** claim described in Section 4.1.1 `SD-JWT`_ and other claims specified in this section.

The claim **_sd_alg** indicates the hash algorithm used by the Issuer to generate the digests as described in Section 4.1.1 of `SD-JWT`_. **_sd_alg** MUST be set to one of the specified algorithms in Section :ref:`Cryptographic Algorithms <algorithms:Cryptographic Algorithms>`.

Claims that are not selectively disclosable MUST be included in the SD-JWT as they are. The digests of the disclosures, along with any decoy if present, MUST be contained in the **_sd** array, as specified in Section 4.2.4.1 of `SD-JWT`_.

Each digest value, calculated using a hash function over the disclosures, verifies the integrity and corresponds to a specific Disclosure. Each disclosure includes:

  - a random salt,
  - the claim name (only when the claim is an object element),
  - the claim value.

In case of nested objects in a SD-JWT payload, each claim at every level of the JSON, should be individually marked as selectively disclosable or not. Therefore **_sd** claim containing digests MAY appear multiple times at different levels in the SD-JWT.

For each claim that is an array element the digests of the respective disclosures and decoy digests are added to the array in the same position of the original claim values as specified in Section 4.2.4.2 of `SD-JWT`_.

In case of array elements, digest values are calculated using a hash function over the disclosures, containing:

  - a random salt,
  - the array element.

In case of multiple array elements, the Issuer may hide the value of the entire array or any of the entry contained within the array, the Holder can disclose both the entire array and any single entry within the array, as defined in Section 4.2.6 of `SD-JWT`_.

The Disclosures are provided to the Holder together with the SD-JWT in the *Combined Format for Issuance* that is an ordered series of base64url-encoded values, each separated from the next by a single tilde ('~') character as follows:

.. code-block:: text

  <Issuer-Signed-JWT>~<Disclosure 1>~<Disclosure 2>~...~<Disclosure N>

See `SD-JWT-VC`_ and `SD-JWT`_ for additional details.

Digital Credential Type Metadata retrieval
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Credential Type Metadata JSON Document MAY be retrieved through a *well-known* endpoint. See Section 6.3.3 of `SD-JWT-VC`_
This endpoint, provided by the Credential Issuer, MUST have the following format: ``https://{Credential Issuer Domain}/.well-known/vct/{vct}``.
The Endpoint returns a ``200 OK`` status code and supports ``application/json`` and ``application/jwt`` as content type.

Below a non-normative example is given.

mdoc-CBOR Credential Format
---------------------------

The mdoc data model is based on the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard.
The mdoc data elements MUST be encoded in CBOR as defined in :rfc:`8949`.

This data model structures mdoc Digital Credentials into distinct components: namespaces (**nameSpaces**), and cryptographic proof (**issuerAuth**).
Namespaces categorize and structure data elements (or attributes, see :ref:`credential-data-model:Attribute Namespaces`). While the cryptographic proof ensures integrity and authenticity through the Mobile Security Object (MSO).

The MSO securely stores cryptographic digests of attributes within the `nameSpaces`. This allows Relying Parties to validate disclosed attributes against corresponding **digestID** values without revealing the entire Credential.
See :ref:`credential-data-model:Mobile Security Object` for details.

An mdoc-CBOR Digital Credential MUST be compliant with the following structure:

.. _table_mdoc_structure:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Parameter**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **nameSpaces**
      - *(map)*. The namespaces within which the data elements are defined. A Digital Credential MAY include multiple namespaces. Mandatory mDL attributes utilize the standard namespace `org.iso.18013.5.1`. However, it MAY have a domestic namespace, such as `org.iso.18013.5.1.IT`, to include additional attributes defined in this implementation profile. Each namespace within the `nameSpaces` MUST share the same issued document type (`docType`) value, which identifies the nature of the Digital Credential, as defined in the `issuerAuth`.
      - [ISO 18013-5#8.3.2.1.2]
    * - **issuerAuth**
      - *(COSE_Sign1)*. Contains *Mobile Security Object* (MSO), a COSE Sign1 Document, issued by the Credential Issuer.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]

The structure of an mdoc-CBOR Credential is further elaborated in the following sections.

Mobile Security Object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **issuerAuth** represents the `Mobile Security Object` which is a `COSE Sign1 Document` defined in :rfc:`9052`. It has the following data structure:

   * protected header
   * unprotected header
   * payload
   * signature.

The **protected header** MUST contain the following parameter encoded in CBOR format:

.. _table_protected_headers_mdoc:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Element**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **1**
      - *(int)*. Algorithm used to verify the cryptographic signature of the mdoc Digital Credential.
      - :rfc:`9053`

.. note::
  Only the signature algorithm MUST be present in the protected header, other elements SHOULD not be present in the protected header.

The **unprotected header** MUST contain the following parameters, unless otherwise specified:

.. _table_unprotected_headers_mdoc:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Element**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **4**
      - *(tstr, OPTIONAL)*. Unique identifier of the Issuer JWK. Required when the Issuer of mdoc uses OpenID Federation.
      - :ref:`trust-infrastructure:The Infrastructure of Trust`
    * - **33**
      - *(array)*. X.509 certificate chain about the Issuer. Required for X.509 certificate-based authentication.
      - :rfc:`9360`

.. note::
  The `x5chain` is included in the unprotected header with the aim to allow the Holder to update the X.509 certificate chain, related to the `Mobile Security Object` issuer, without invalidating the signature.

The **payload** MUST contain the *MobileSecurityObject*, without the `content-type` COSE Sign header parameter and encoded as a *byte string* (bstr) using the *CBOR Tag* 24.

The `MobileSecurityObject` MUST have the following attributes, unless otherwise specified:

.. _table_MobileSecurityObject_attributes:
.. list-table::
    :class: longtable
    :widths: 20 60 20
    :header-rows: 1

    * - **Element**
      - **Description**
      - **Reference**
    * - **docType**
      - *(tstr)*. Defines the type of mdoc Digital Credential being issued. For example, for an mDL, the value MUST be ``org.iso.18013.5.1.mDL``. Specific `docType` MAY be defined for Digital Credential other than mDL.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]
    * - **version**
      - *(tstr)*. Version of the `MobileSecurityObject`.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]

          * **signed** *(tdate)*. The timestamp indicating when the `MobileSecurityObject` was signed.
          * **validFrom** *(tdate)*. Timestamp before which the `MobileSecurityObject` is not considered valid. MUST be equal to or later than the `signed` time.
          * **validUntil** *(tdate)*. Timestamp after which the `MobileSecurityObject` is no longer considered valid.

      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]
    * - **digestAlgorithm**
      - *(tstr)*. Identifier of the digest algorithm, which MUST match the algorithm defined in the protected header.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]
    * - **valueDigests**
      - *(map)*. Maps each namespace identifier to a set of digests, where each digest is keyed by a unique `digestID` and holds the digest value.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]
    * - **deviceKeyInfo**
      - *(map)*. Contains metadata about the Wallet Instance's public key. It MUST include the following sub-fields, unless otherwise specified:

          * **deviceKey** *(COSE_Key)*. Contains the public key parameters.
          * **keyAuthorizations** *(map, OPTIONAL)*. Defines authorizations for either full namespaces or individual data elements.
          * **keyInfo** *(map, OPTIONAL)*. Contains additional metadata about the key.

      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.4]
    * - **status**
      - *(map, CONDITIONAL)*. REQUIRED only if the Digital Credential is long-lived. Contains the MSO revocation information. If present, it includes a *status_list* based on the TOKEN-STATUS-LIST_ mechanism. This mechanism uses a bit array to mark revoked MSOs by their index position.
        The `status_list` MUST contain the following sub-values:

          * **idx**. Position index in the status list.
          * **uri**. URI pointing to the status list resource.
      - [ISO 18013-5#9.1.2.6]

.. note::
  The private key related to the public key stored in the `deviceKey` map is used to sign the `DeviceSignedItems` and to prove the possession of the Digital Credential during the presentation phase (see the presentation phase with mdoc-CBOR).

Attribute Namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **nameSpaces** contains one or more *nameSpace* entries, each identified by a name. Within each **nameSpace**, it includes one or more *IssuerSignedItemBytes*, each encoded as a CBOR byte string with Tag 24 (#6.24(bstr .cbor)), which appears as 24(<<... >>) in diagnostic notation. It represents the disclosure information for each digest within the `Mobile Security Object` and MUST contain the following attributes:

.. note::
  Digital Credential User-specific attributes are defined in the Catalog of Digital Credentials.
  User-specific attributes for mdoc Digital Credentials such as those used in mDL or PID are also included by referencing the appropriate `elementIdentifiers` defined in ISO/IEC 18013-5 or the `EIDAS-ARF`_ specification.

.. note::
  Regardless of the Digital Credential type, the `sub` value MUST NOT be shown to the User, as it is not a User attribute. It is used for identification purposes by the Credential Issuers.

PID Data Model in mdoc-CBOR Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PID in mdoc-CBOR format (ISO/IEC 18013-5 compliant) SHALL use the **docType** ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1`` as specified in ARF requirement **PID_04**.

The PID attributes SHALL be encoded as specified in **Section 3 of the ARF PID Rulebook v1.3** [`EIDAS-ARF`_], which defines:

- Attribute identifiers and their encoding formats (Section 3.1.1)
- Specific encoding rules for ``nationality`` (Section 3.1.2), ``birth_date`` (Section 3.1.4), and ``place_of_birth`` (Section 3.1.5)
- CBOR canonical encoding requirements (:RFC:`8949` Section 4.2)

.. note::
   **Key differences from SD-JWT encoding:**

   ARF uses different claim names between SD-JWT and mdoc-CBOR formats:

   - mdoc uses ``birth_date`` (not ``birthdate`` as in SD-JWT)
   - mdoc uses ``expiry_date`` (not ``date_of_expiry`` as in SD-JWT)
   - Both formats use ``place_of_birth`` with the same CBOR map structure

   See ARF Section 3.1.1 (mdoc encoding) and Section 4.1.1 (SD-JWT encoding) for the complete mapping.

**Italian PID Requirements:**

For Italian PIDs, the following requirements apply:

- The ``verification`` attribute (defined in :ref:`Attributes <table_element_identifiers_mdoc>`) is REQUIRED (whereas it is OPTIONAL for other credential types).
- At least one of the following identifiers MUST be present:

  - ``personal_administrative_number`` (ARF Section 2.2, standard attribute, namespace ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1``)
  - ``tax_id_code`` (Italian domestic extension, namespace ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``)

**Domestic Extensions (ARF requirement PID_06):**

The following domestic attribute is defined for Italian PIDs and SHALL be placed in the domestic namespace ``eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.it.1``:

Cross-Format Credential Parameters Mapping
------------------------------------------

The following table provides a comparative mapping between the data structures of SD-JWT-VC and mdoc-CBOR Digital Credentials.
It outlines the key data elements and parameters used in each format, highlighting both commonalities and differences.
In particular, it shows how core concepts - such as Credential Issuer information, validity, Cryptographic Binding, and disclosures - are represented in these Credential formats.

For SD-JWT-VC, parameters are marked with `(hdr)` if they are located in the JOSE header, and `(pld)` if they appear in the payload of the JWT. In mdoc-CBOR, these parameters are identified within the issuerAuth or nameSpaces structures.

.. note::
  - In the mdoc-CBOR format, the version of the Digital Credential is not explicitly defined; it is only available for the IssuerAuth. In contrast, the SD-JWT format includes version information via the `vct` URN.
  - `Disclosures`, `_sd`, and `_sd_alg` enable Selective Disclosure of SD-JWT claims. The `_sd` and `_sd_alg` parameters are part of the SD-JWT payload, while `Disclosures` are sent separately in a Combined Format along with the SD-JWT.
  - The `Type_Metadata.claims` parameter in SD-JWT and the `nameSpaces` structure in mdoc-CBOR are functionally equivalent, as both define the claim names and their structure. SD-JWT `Disclosures` for disclosed attributes directly correspond to `nameSpaces`, including attribute names, values, and salt values.
  - A domestic namespace accommodates attributes such as `verification` and `sub`, which are not defined in the standard ISO elementIdentifiers for mdoc-CBOR Digital Credentials.
